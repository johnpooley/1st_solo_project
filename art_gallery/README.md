#John Pooley - Art Gallery - Solo Project

This was my first solo project as a coder. It uses Ruby with the Sinatra framework.

[A brief for the project can be found here](https://gist.github.com/kingdomlevel/703b242ea34566db093156a560e064b8) 

##Running The Project

to run this project you simply need to be in the root directory in Terminal, then type _ruby frontpage.rb_.
You can now access the app at _localhost:4567_
